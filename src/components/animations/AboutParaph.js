        I'm a french computer enthusiast and i learn computer development in a
        digital school.
        I'm currently studying in BTS Computer services for organizations and more
        precisely in
        computer development.
        <br/><br/>
        It has been now some years since I became fascinated by the world of
        internet technology
        and everything that has to do with the internet. I develop websites for my
        friends, my family and I participate in various development projects
        from scratch.
        <br/><br/>
        At the moment, I'm trying to increase my skills in interface development
        with React.js and learn server side development with Node.js.
