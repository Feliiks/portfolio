        Here is a list of some of the projects I have been able to contribute to
        in the last few months.
        <br/><br/>
        Participating in new projects as a developer is very important to learn
        new things.
        Working with many different people allows you to deepen what you
        already know but also to learn.
        <br/><br/>
        For the moment the list is short as I am only a student. I have been
        regularly working on different projects for a few months now so this
        list will grow.
        <br/><br/>
        Currently, I work mainly on the front-end/back-end of a few
        projects on the side of my studies.
        <br/><br/>

        informations.
