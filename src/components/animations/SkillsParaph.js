      <p>
        I first got interested in front-end development in 2019 by learning the
        basics of HTML, then I wanted to style my websites by learning CSS as
        well as the Bootstrap framework.
        <br/><br/>
        Since the beginning of 2021, I give more importance to Javascript and
        Typescript based technologies. I am learning to use React.js associated
        with several tools like Axios, Redux or Firebase for example.
        <br/><br/>
        For the server side, I am learning to develop Rest APIs using Node.js
        coupled with Express.js, the Prisma ORM and several DBMS like MySQL or
        MongoDB.
        <br/><br/>
        Increasing my skills and becoming a fullstack web developer are my main
        goals.
